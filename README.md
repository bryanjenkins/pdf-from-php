# PDF from PHP

It seems like every application I build eventually needs the ability to export a PDF for reporting purposes. This repository helps get that done quickly.

### Requirements

- PHP
- FPDF

### Installation

You'll need to include the FPDF directory in your folder and use the example implementation as an example. I created a class called PDF_reciept that inherits from FPDF.


### Reference
- [FPDF Library]
